This was our term project for ME 30.  

Things I liked about the project: 
  - No other group in our section has a randomize feature like ours did
  - The game looped and continued to keep playing even if you lost the previous game
  - When it loops back to the startup screen, you could hold down the A button to turn off the CPX board

Things I wish we could improve on:
  - Once the button registers the correct player input, it would move onto the next set of games
  - More memory on the board so that we could have a 2 player game
  - A more creative twist on the game. A lot of other groups did something similar to ours, so maybe we should have added a brand new game or any other feature that would have made ours more unique.

I really enjoyed working on this project. I want to be able to code more complex programs.
